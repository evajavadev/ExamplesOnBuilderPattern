# Examples On Builder Pattern

<br>

> Below some different program examples on the builder design pattern. 

<br>

My own *simple definition* of what a builder pattern does, is just that its `Builder class` replaces most of the `setters`. And this is great when for example a complex object needs to create several different representations. Using the same construction proccess. 

The purpose can be to protect the data, so only the `Builder` knows the specifics.   

To make this happen, a `public static Builder class` is created. And its `constructor`. And these two guys must reside inside the `public class of the Data`.
